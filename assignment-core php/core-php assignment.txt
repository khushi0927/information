         PHP SYNTAX :


    1]  Discuss the structure of a PHP script and how to embed PHP in HTML.
    ->  Basic structure
                <?PHP
                    echo"khushi";
                ?>


    ->    embeding PHP in HTML
                <!DOCTYPE html>
                            <html>
                            <head>
                                <title>PHP in HTML</title>
                            </head>
                            <body>
                                <h1>Welcome!</h1>
                                <p>
                                    <?php
                                        echo"khushi";
                                    ?>
                                </p>
                            </body>
                            </html>


    2] Rules for Naming Variables in PHP.
    ->  Variable names are case-sensitive.
    ->  The first character after $ must be a letter (a–z, A–Z) or underscore (_).
    ->  After the first character, you can use letters, numbers, and underscores.
    ->  Must begin with a $ sign.
    ->  Cannot use reserved keywords as variable names.



        PHP VARIABLES :

    1] Explain the concept of variables in PHP and their scope.

    ->  1. Concept of Variables in PHP

    ->    A variable in PHP is a container that stores data, which can be used and changed during program execution.

    ->    Key Points about Variables

    ->  Always start with $.

    ->  Value can change (hence called variable).

    ->  No need to declare type (PHP is loosely typed).


    ->  2. Scope of Variables in PHP.

    (a) Local Scope :

           -> Variables declared inside a function.

           -> Accessible only within that function.

    (b) Global Scope

            -> Variables declared outside functions.

            -> Can’t be accessed directly inside functions unless declared as global.

    (c) Static Scope

            -> A variable inside a function normally resets each time the function runs.

            -> If declared as static, it retains its value between function calls.

    (d) Super Global Variables

            -> Built-in variables available everywhere (global + local).




    CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS :

    1]  Explain how conditional statements workin PHP.

    -> Conditional statements let your program make decisions and execute different code depending on whether a condition is true or false.


        1. if Statement

            Executes code only if the condition is true.


        2. if...else Statement

            Executes one block if the condition is true, otherwise another block.


        3. if...elseif...else Statement

            Used to check multiple conditions.


        4. switch Statement

            Alternative to multiple if...elseif. Compares a value against different cases.



                        || Loops: Do-While, ForEach, ForLoop ||


               1] do-While :

                Use-case:do  while loop is used to executed when condition is true but do will be exuted once time either condition is true or false.

               2] ForEach  :

                Use-case : foreach is used to convert any array as values in php.

               3] ForLoop :

                Use-case :  for loop are executed when condition is true.


                    
                      ||  Difference ||

            | ------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
            | **for**      | Fixed number of iterations        | Before each iteration | Printing 1 to 100             |
            | **foreach**  | Iterating over arrays/collections | Automatic             | Looping through colors list   |
            | **do-while** | At least one execution guaranteed | After each iteration  | Taking user input until valid |
