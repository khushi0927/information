1)  What is CSS? How does it differ from HTML?
-> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
-> It is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation (look and feel) of a web page written in HTML.


    Difference Between CSS and HTML
Feature              	HTML	                                                 CSS
Full Form       	HyperText Markup Language	                          Cascading Style Sheets
Purpose         	Structures content on the web	                      Styles and formats that content
Function	        Adds elements (e.g., paragraphs, images, links)	      Adds styles (e.g., color, font size)
File Type	        .html	                                               .css
Syntax	Uses tags   (<p>, <img>)	                                       Uses selectors (p, .class) and rules (color: red;)
Example	            <h1>Hello</h1>	                                       h1 { color: blue; }


2) Explain the three way stoapply CSS to a web page.
->
         1. Inline CSS
            CSS is added directly inside an HTML element using the style attribute.

             Example:

            <p style="color: blue; font-size: 18px;">This is a blue paragraph.</p>


        2. Internal CSS
            CSS is written within a <style> tag inside the <head> section of the HTML file.

             Example:

                <!DOCTYPE html>
                <html>
                <head>
                    <style>
                        p {
                            color: green;
                            font-size: 18px;
                        }
                    </style>
                    </head>
                    <body>
                        <p>This is a green paragraph.</p>
                    </body>
                </html>


        3. External CSS
             CSS is written in a separate file (usually with a .css extension) and linked to the HTML file using the <link> tag.

             Example:
                HTML (index.html):

                <!DOCTYPE html>
                <html>
                <head>
                    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
                </head>
                <body>
                    <p>This is styled with external CSS.</p>
                </body>
                </html>

        CSS (styles.css):

            p {
                    color: red;
                    font-size: 20px;
            }

        
3)  What are CSS selectors? List and describe the different types of selectors.
->  What are CSS Selectors?
    CSS selectors are patterns used to target and select HTML elements that you want to style.

    Selectors tell the browser which elements a set of CSS rules should apply to.

     Types of CSS Selectors:

             1. Element Selector
                - Targets elements by their tag name.

                    p {
                            color: blue;
                    }


            2. Class Selector (.classname)
                - Selects all elements with a specific class attribute.

                    .box {
                             border: 1px solid black;
                        }


            3. ID Selector (#id)
                - Targets a single, unique element by its ID.

                    #header {
                                 background-color: gray;
                            }


            4. Universal Selector (*)
                - Selects all elements on the page.

                    * {
                        margin: 0;
                        padding: 0;
                    }


            5. Group Selector
                - Applies the same style to multiple selectors.

                    h1, h2, p {
                         font-family: Arial;
                        }



4) What is the box model in CSS? Explain its components.
->  The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept that describes how every HTML element is essentially a rectangular box, and how spacing and sizing are applied to that box.

    It defines how elements are rendered and how space is allocated around them.


     1. Content
            The actual content inside the element (text, images, etc.)

            Size is set by width and height


    2. Padding
            Space inside the border, between content and border

            Increases the clickable or readable area without affecting layout

     3. Border
            A line around the padding and content

            Can have style, width, and color

     4. Margin
            Space outside the border, used to create space between elements

            Affects element's position relative to others
